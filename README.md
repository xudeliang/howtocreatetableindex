How to batch create indexes for multiple tables in the database




Batch Index Creation Requirement: Python code has been made public at https://github.com/xudeliang/howtocreatetableindex.git.

In database technology, an important concept is indexing, which can significantly improve data retrieval speed. Since database administrators donâ€™t write business logic, they may not know which fields require indexing. If backend developers add indexes to tables while writing code, it can be inefficient, as different developers may use different search conditions. This code addresses the issue by enabling batch index creation.



run python3 batchCreateIndexes.py

Output file indexOut.txt
